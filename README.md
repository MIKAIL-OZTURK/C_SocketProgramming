# Socket Programming (TCP/IP)
This is a TCP/IP socket program written in the C programming language. The program consists of a server and a client. The server listens for incoming connection requests on a specified IP address and port. The client connects to the server 
on the same IP address and port and sends a message. The server receives the message from the client and prints it to the screen. After the process is complete, the connections are closed and the program terminates.
